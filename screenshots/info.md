This is my first test applying GLSL shaders to a test texture.
At this point I was not yet very comfortable with OpenGL and GLSL which is why I started out by experimenting with various little graphical effects.

The first shader somewhat resembling lighting.
Since this is all based on a single heightmap the result includes visible artifacting.

Here I've added shadows to the image. The method I've used is inefficient so this version of the program runs at a very low framerate.
